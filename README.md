## Swatched.io

Welcome to my passion project.

I love desiging with colours, and I am always looking for inspiration to help find new and interesting pallettes.

This is a next.js web app, leveraging the colormind API to help users find, save, and compare colours.

The UI is developed around D3.js, and utilises some fun / complex hover effects.

You can view this app here - swatched.io
